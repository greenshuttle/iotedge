/// + type - Required. The data type of the value. Supported types are bool, int8 - int64, uint8 - uint64, float32, float64, string, binary and arrays of the primitive types (ints, floats, bool). Arrays are specified as eg. float32array, boolarray etc.
/// + readWrite - R, RW, or W indicating whether the value is readable or writable.
/// + defaultValue - a value used for PUT requests which do not specify one.
/// + base - a value to be raised to the power of the raw reading before it is returned.
/// + scale - a factor by which to multiply a reading before it is returned.
/// + offset - a value to be added to a reading before it is returned.
/// + mask - a binary mask which will be applied to an integer reading.
/// + shift - a number of bits by which an integer reading will be shifted right.
